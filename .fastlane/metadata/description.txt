Overamped automatically redirects AMP and Yandex Turbo to their original version, effectively disabling AMP and Yandex Turbo in Safari.

HOW IT WORKS
When opening a link from any source – including Google Search, Google News, Yahoo! JAPAN, any website, and native apps – Overamped will find and redirect to the canonical version automatically. This means it will work with all AMP and Yandex Turbo pages no matter how the page is opened.

OPEN NATIVE APPS
If you have the native app installed for a website that is redirected Overamped will automatically open the native app rather than the website.

SAFARI HISTORY
Websites redirected by Overamped won't appear in your history and going back or forward will never load the AMP or Yandex Turbo page.

DISABLE OVERAMPED FOR SPECIFIC WEBSITES
If you prefer the AMP or Yandex Turbo version of a website you can disable Overamped for any websites you choose.

SOURCE CODE
The source code for the Overamped app and web extension is available on GitHub, allowing you to audit the code and validate that your privacy is respected.

STATISTICS
Overamped can display statistics, including how many AMP results have been found and how many redirections Overamped has performed. All statistics are exclusively on-device.

PRIVACY
Overamped does not transmit any data off the device. This means that none of your data is shared, sold, or otherwise given to any third parties.
