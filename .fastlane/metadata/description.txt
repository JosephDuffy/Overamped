Amped is a Safari Extension that redirects AMP pages in Google and Bing search results and links opened from other apps.

It does not collect, share, or sell any of your personal data, including what you search or any pages you open.

The extension can be configured from within Safari to allow specific sites of your choosing to still use AMP, or to only redirect the AMP versions of specific websites.

AMP pages redirected from search results don't appear in your history and going back or forward will never load the AMP page.
