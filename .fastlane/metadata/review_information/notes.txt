A demo video of the extension: https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0CrIK3GXyer7_XpcMC4vUq27A#App_Review_Demo

Overamped is not enabled at the start of the video. Note how tapping the news result in Google opens the AMP version of the page (website is hosted by Google, shows actual website domain at top, the website is missing some features such as the navigation menu). Once the extension has been enabled and the page refresh tapping the same link instead loads the original page.
