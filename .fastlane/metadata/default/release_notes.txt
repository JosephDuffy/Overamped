Thank you to everyone that has downloaded Overamped!

This update includes a change that will hopefully prevent all recursive redirects, e.g. when a website automatically redirects to the AMP version. Unfortunately it's not possible to prevent the redirection to the AMP version but this fix should prevent the page repeatedly reloading.
