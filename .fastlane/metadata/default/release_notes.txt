Thank you to everyone that has downloaded Overamped! More features are planned for the future.

The source code of Overamped is now available on GitHub! You can find the link in the About tab.

This build also fixes some bugs:

- Fix showing “Overamped” in place of “Safari” in installation instructions
- Prevent infinite redirections to student.si and thehustle.co
