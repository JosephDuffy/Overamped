This build is using the Xcode 13 RC and is intended to be the version submitted to the App Store, unless there are any major issues discovered.

Thank you to everyone that's been using Overamped, especially those that have provide feedback. It's great to hear how much people have been enjoying it and I'm really thankful for the bug reports!

Once the app has been released I would really appreciate reviews in the App Store and mentions of social media!
