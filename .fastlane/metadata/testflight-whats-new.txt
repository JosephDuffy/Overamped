**Please note that a crash on launch or in the background is caused by changes in the iOS beta. If you're using iOS 15 beta 4 (19A5307g) you will need to stay on build 11.**

  - Enabling access to all websites is strongly recommended now

- Hopefully fix Google News for everyone (please let me know)
