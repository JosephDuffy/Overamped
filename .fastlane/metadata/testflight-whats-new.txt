Thank you to everyone that's been using Overamped, especially those that have provide feedback. It's great to hear how much people have been enjoying it!

For the next update I am working on supporting more websites (Google News, Bing, etc.), but there's more to come (see the bottom).

New in beta 5:

- Support for Google News
  - Due to how Google News uses AMP it is not currently possible to support for allow list

New in beta 4:

- Support for AMP links in more contexts, e.g. the Images tab, featured articles, more recipes
- Improve logic for removing AMP from final URL, e.g. striping "/amp/" from the final URL
- Redirect AMP pages linked from other apps (e.g. Messages) and any website
  - This means that if someone links directly to an AMP URL it will still be redirected, but due to security restrictions the page has to load at least a small amount before the redirection can occur
- Updated icon
- Reduce permissions required to function

New in beta 3:

- Improved instruction to enable the extension

New in beta 2:

- Enable allowing AMP for specific websites
- Support overriding AMP links for news articles
- Better detection of original non-AMP URL
- Loading more search results will redetect AMP links

Upcoming features:

- Support for Google News
- Support for Google Images
- Support for Bing
- Improved installation steps
- More information and shortcuts within the extension
