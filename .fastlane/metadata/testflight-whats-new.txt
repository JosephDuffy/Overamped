Advanced Statistics now displays the most recent events and links to a screen that displays each event that has occurred and allows for the deletion of individual events.

These recent events can also be viewed in a new widget. The design of this widget is very basic and will be improved.

The widget doesn't yet display a message when empty or refresh when the app is opened. These changes will be made before the update is submitted to the App Store.
