Thank you to everyone that's been using Overamped, especially those that have provide feedback. It's great to hear how much people have been enjoying it and really thankful for the bug reports!

New in beta 11:

- The "de-AMPing" of URLs in Google results has been added again, reducing the need for access to "Other Websites"
- The options page opened from Settings > Safari > Extensions > Overamped > Extension Settings has an improved design
- The popup displayed when choosing Overamped from Safari's More menu has a loading state while the current page is being queried
- The extension settings can be opened from the popup

New in beta 10:

- Remove manual "de-AMPing" of URLs to fix some websites, e.g. amp.dev
  - Enabling access to all websites is strongly recommended now
- Improve explanation and collections of statistics
- Implement advanced statistics

New in beta 9:

- Google's AMP cache (/amp/s/ links) are now handled better and will redirect to the same URL displayed in the "i" dropdown
- Support for Yandex Turbo
  - Note this requires access for every website individually, or you can provide access to all websites
- Improvements to installation instructions

New in beta 8:

- Hopefully fix Google News for everyone (please let me know)
- Fix close button on images linking to the Google homepage
- The canonical version of AMP pages can be manually opened from within the extension
  - I'm working on making this automatic but it will require the extension to have more permissions
- Rework app tabs, hide them before extension has been enabled
- Ignored websites can be deleted from the Overamped app
  - Existing ignored hostnames will be migrated to the app when the extension is next loaded
- Improvements to feedback form
- Add base for Statistics tab. It's current static and no statistics are being collected.

New in beta 7:

- Opening the extension on Google will display the number of AMP links that have been replaced
- An alternative feedback form has been added to the app, which can be launched from the popover

New in beta 6:

- Fix some links not being de-AMPed after loading more results
- Improve wording of disable/enable Overamped button

New in beta 5:

- Support for Google News
  - Due to how Google News uses AMP it is not currently possible to support for allow list

New in beta 4:

- Support for AMP links in more contexts, e.g. the Images tab, featured articles, more recipes
- Improve logic for removing AMP from final URL, e.g. striping "/amp/" from the final URL
- Redirect AMP pages linked from other apps (e.g. Messages) and any website
  - This means that if someone links directly to an AMP URL it will still be redirected, but due to security restrictions the page has to load at least a small amount before the redirection can occur
- Updated icon
- Reduce permissions required to function

New in beta 3:

- Improved instruction to enable the extension

New in beta 2:

- Enable allowing AMP for specific websites
- Support overriding AMP links for news articles
- Better detection of original non-AMP URL
- Loading more search results will redetect AMP links

Upcoming features:

- Improvements to the UI shown within Safari
- Support for Bing
- Improved installation steps
- More information and shortcuts within the extension
