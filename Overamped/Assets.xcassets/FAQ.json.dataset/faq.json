Without access to “Other Websites” Overamped will make a best guess to “de-AMP” the URL, but this will not always work.","This is because not all website use URLs that can be “de-AMP” using a single algorithm. For example for an abc.net.au article Google provides the URL `https://amp.abc.net.au/article/100303036` but removing the `amp.` subdomain will yield `https://abc.net.au/article/100303036`, a URL that cannot be found (also known as a 404 error).","When access to “Other Websites” is provided Overamped will skip the Google AMP cache but will still load the AMP version of the search result. As soon as the AMP version starts to load it will read the real canonical version of webpage and redirect to it."],"id":"why-other-websites-permission","platforms":["app","website"]},{"title":"A specific website isn't redirecting correctly, can I provide access to only that website to fix the redirection?","answer":["Yes, providing access to specific websites will also fix incorrect redirects. To provide access to a specific website first visit the website, then open Overamped on that page and grant access to the website.","Note that any new permissions will not be applied until pages that Overamped is active on are reloaded."],"platforms":["app","website"]}]
